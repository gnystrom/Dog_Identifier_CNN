Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
(Presented in no particular order ...)

(1) AUGMENT THE TRAINING DATA
Augmenting the training and/or validation set might help improve model performance.

(2) TURN YOUR ALGORITHM INTO A WEB APP
Turn your code into a web app using Flask or web.py!

(4) ADD FUNCTIONALITY FOR DOG MUTTS
Currently, if a dog appears 51% German Shephard and 49% poodle, only the German Shephard breed is returned. The algorithm is currently guaranteed to fail for every mixed breed dog. Of course, if a dog is predicted as 99.5% Labrador, it is still worthwhile to round this to 100% and return a single breed; so, you will have to find a nice balance.

(5) EXPERIMENT WITH MULTIPLE DOG/HUMAN DETECTORS
Perform a systematic evaluation of various methods for detecting humans and dogs in images. Provide improved methodology for the face_detector and dog_detector functions.
